When there is a sexual interaction, or there is any kind of intimacy which involves thought,
5:41
emotion and body, the amount of memory that is left in your system is very big.
5:48
It is from this context, they said, “You must keep this as simple as possible.”
5:53
There are other aspects where, in certain tantric process and all they are involving,
5:57
they are preparing themselves for years to distance themselves from the body in such a way,
6:02
that the body doesn’t pick up anything from anywhere.
6:06
This is being done like a sadhana, not as sexual promiscuity.
6:09
So, the question is not of morality,
6:13
the question is of what is it that you want to do with yourself in your life.
6:18
If you want to be in such a way
6:21
that in your life, your inner intelligence will be the most dominant thing in your life,
6:27
not your physical body,
6:28
then you must keep the body’s memory as simple as possible."

If you drink any liquid along with your food, the acids that are necessary for digestive process will get diluted,
17:14
your whole digestive process gets inefficient. Because food, when it goes in, if it contains water,it's assists.
17:23
But if you put any liquid on top of it, you will see the food will remain in the stomach bag for too long.
17:29
We are very concerned about this always, in the yogic culture and life,
17:34
that we don't want food to remain in our stomach bag for more than two-and-a-half hours maximum.
17:40
In two-and-a-half hours' time, it doesn't matter what I've eaten, how much I've eaten, it must go into other parts. If it remains there, it makes you dull,
17:51
it makes you lose your sense of perception. The level of perception, the keenness of perception is lost, which you notice,"
"29:21 how do we get out of this i'm not
enough drama?
no no you should not get out of it that is the best thing that happened to happen to a human being
the best thing that's happened to be a human being is there is a limitless desire to expand
otherwise we would be like any other creature stomach full nothing more
29:43
see this is the nature of all the other creatures stomach full life settle for all of them
29:48
their basic survival is taken care of after that they don't want to do anything but the nature of the human
29:55
being is such that only after the survival process is taken care of does
30:01
really being human kicking what does being human mean being human means just
30:06
this whoever you are right now it's not enough you want to be something more
30:11
this is the most fantastic thing that's happened to us it's not a syndrome it is the greatest thing that's happened to us
30:17
because we want to expand limitlessly ------------------------------- NEXT CUT:

31:10 boundless expansion is your fundamental desire but
31:12
unfortunately for most people it is finding a very constipated expression
31:19
the basic desire is to expand boundlessly but they are going shopping
31:25
okay they are trying to satisfy this in installments you cannot attend to an
31:31
infinite longing in installments there is no way to do that so the
31:36
problem is not the fundamental desire to expand limitlessly the problem is the
31:42
way you're addressing it

"34:15
this is why i said that simple process every day you invest 12 15 minutes a day you can come to this if you're more
34:22
serious about making this a part of your existence then you need to engineer yourself a bit
34:29
there's nothing wrong with you because you're german i'm saying engineering okay
34:37
because i am talking engineering because engineering is something that you trust
34:43
if an angel comes down today tonight
34:48
an angel comes down and say come let us fly jump out of your fifth floor window
34:54
will you jump out with the angel no no but if a pilot comes and shows you a
35:00
mechanical object like this and say let's fly you will go safe so what i'm saying is
35:07
what i'm saying is you trust engineering more than all the angel stuff all the
35:13
heavenly stuff all the magic stuff you trust engineering more than anything
35:18
else this is not just because you're german this is the entire world this is every human being on the planet

this is why it is inner engineering you engineer yourself in such a way that it works for you that's it

"I am advising everyone of you, keep a lamp in your bedroom, in a safe distance from you where you sleep, and let it burn every night. It will make a world of difference for you. So otherwise, you must have a powerfully consecrated spaces which is like fire burning all the time. Either this or that, one of the things must be done in every home. Always a lamp used to be burning, always in an Indian home. Now unfortunately because people are seeing it as an act of a particular religion, others don't want light. Otherwise others don't want to wear a lighter lamp because if you light a lamp you may get converted this is just stupid."
"Everybody will hurt you. There is no such perfect human being who will not hurt you. Everybody will hurt you. If you're waiting for that perfect, on the White Horse Knight, there's no such man. Believe me."
"How I am is my choice, this is my way. No matter what they do, I am like this. Because I am not given the freedom to anybody that somebody can freak me, somebody can make me angry, somebody can make me happy, somebody can make me unhappy, these privileges I kept to myself. It's time you do that too, because if somebody else can decide what can happen within you right now, using this ultimate slavery."
"Horoscopes are being matched. What it means is, stars are being matched. But how do you match these two idiots? It's not possible. Nobody can match these two idiots. Only if they take responsibility for each other, if they show some sense of involvement and invest their lives in each other, then something wonderful may happen. If you match them, doesn't matter how you match them. Nothing is going to work out. This is why for most people all love us and marriages are beautiful only for some time after that it's one big anxiety or nonstop friction simply because people are trying to match each other. You cannot match people. No two human beings are same. It will not work that way. It is just that if you hold the other person's well being above your own, then you will find everything works out. If your life is about extracting happiness from somebody else, you will see it will become bitter over a period of time. If your life is about sharing the joy that you are, then everything will work out. It doesn't matter what the stars say and how silly is it, that a third person that you do not know is going to tell you whether you will live happily or not with your husband or your wife. How vulgar is that? Take up this responsibility in your hand. It doesn't matter what kind of fool you marry. You take up the responsibility that you will live well and that's the only way you will While the"
"But I was in London and you know what happens to when you are in a beautiful city with great infrastructure you with a couple of friends and your Indian friend always comes to India. You know all this so great we will live with a piece of coverage. Well, the city that you're appreciating of its infrastructure and its well and well being. But two centuries was largely built on stolen money from this company. Thank you. It's not the only thing that you've seen. It's not the same. It's the only thing that you've seen. It's the only thing that you've seen. We should not share. We should not get a sandwich. Our history, there's not a scandalosity to it somebody. We want it to the same time it's to be forget every day and go on as if nothing happened"
"You are only working. What will I get? What will I get? What the hell will you get? You'll die one day, that's all."
"He killed thousands of men wherever he went. In any town he went, he'll all the men burn the town down. Capture the women and children. Women were brutally raped always in public. In thousands, Baba sold the Hindu woman in the markets of Khandar and Kabul. So the legacy of Baba should be raised from this country in every way. Above all, nobody should ever identify the present generation of Muslims with Baba because the trussity is that he was. He did not commit atrocity, he is an atrocity. Many times he ransacked Muslim towns also Muslim populations also he killed. So he used religion very conveniently according to his convenience. So him building mosques is not out of baby, not out of devotion, not for prayer. It is also an establishment of power. Whether it's a Hindu temple or a Jain temple, everything he broke. So this man and his legacy should be forgotten. Nobody should do the crime of identifying present-day Muslims with this man because he is not a devout Muslim by any standards. He is not a devotee of any kind. He is a tyrant of the worst kind who very powerfully used the name of religion to impact wherever he went."
"And falling in love. You don't rise in love. You don't fly in love. You fall in love. Because something of who you want has to go. Something of what you think I am should fall. Only then there is a lot of faith. You're willing to destroy a bit of your self for the sake of the other. A bit. Because love means essentially. Somebody else has become far more important than yourself. Only if what you consider as myself falls, something far bigger than you have. [MUSIC PLAYING]"
"If you want breakfast, you want the recipe. You take your handful of ground nut, soak it in water for 6 to 8 hours. Put it in the mixie. If you want to add some fruit, you add a banana, whatever you like, banana goes well. If you want, put some honey into it. Two minutes. You have excellent breakfast, ready? If you want it, little water you put and just drink it up. You want it like parrots, you make it, they can you eat it. You will see easily, keep you for 4 to 5 hours, and it drink it up. You want it like parrots? You make it, they can you eat it. You will see easily, he keeps you for 4 to 5 hours and it's highly nutritious."
"If you love somebody, it's a fickle happening because no human being will happen 100% the way you want them. Every human being on this planet is going to disappoint you, believe me. Not because they'll do something wrong because nobody can fulfill the unrealistic expectation you have of them. It's simply not possible. Unless you're still such a hopeless romantic, you're still waiting. That ideal person is going to come from somewhere. No, believe me, whoever comes. I want you to know. The ideal people whom you worship, when Krishna was there, his wife's complaint. All right. So there is no hope for us. Yes. Please remember this."
"Tell me as a woman on those days of the month. Would you like a break? Because everything was physical in those days. Cooking was not like, you know, you put it in the microwave. The cutting, grinding, lifting, bringing water, enormous amount of physical labor. So those days, they said you don't enter the kitchen. Now puja, in my grandfather's place and all that, puja room is like a third of this home. Dozens and dozens of gods and goddesses clean the puja room. Prepare all these things, put flowers, make a prasadam this day. A whole lot of work. So again, she got a break. So generally she was given break from everything because that's the only holiday she got in a month. You don't have to cook for your family, you don't even have to serve God and that day. Lay everybody alone, take care of yourself, he's indeed a wonderful process. We are looking at it from the wrong side of history, wrong side of times in which we are."
"At one point, Krishna says like this, that, where people sing, laugh, cry, dance, without any sense of hesitation or shame. Such people will purify the universe."
"What are you fearful about? Something that will happen or you think will happen, isn't it? Fear is always about something which does not exist right now, it's always about what will happen. So you are suffering that which does not exist."
"Say, the greatest crime committed on this planet is the idea of heaven. Because the moment you tell someone, this is not the place to live well. This is another place where you're going to go and live well. It's a crime against humanity. -Chilly? -It is. Because you're making sure people don't live well here, they'll wait to live well elsewhere. I'm asking, do you have any proof that you are not already in heaven and making a mess out of it? Yeah, there isn't. Oh, hell. That's up to you. So essentially, human experience can be either like heaven or like hell. Don't say that another place is there which is more beautiful than this, which is better than this. This is because you are living badly. You think there's another place where you will go only well. All the sort of people that they say they went to heaven. I don't want to be in their company. So this is the idea of heaven. It's supposed to be very beautiful but once you go there there's no way out. I don't want to go there. Yes."
"If you have love for somebody, it's worth compromising every damn thing. If you have no love for a time, it's best that you're more away, because otherwise it'll become obscene. Being in too much proximity, without the necessary lubrication of love, will make situations very obscene. Before it becomes obscene, it's better distance happens."
"Suppose you and me are walking and you are in competition with me. You will either get to walk slightly faster than me or probably less than me and feel depressed about it. If you walk little faster than me, you are going to be thinking you reach the peak of your life. If you fall behind me, you feel depressed that you can't walk as fast as me. But if you're not in competition with myself, you would explore the possibilities of what you could do and maybe we don't know you could fly. I can walk fast maybe you could fly but you will miss out the possibility of flying because you're in competition with me all you want to do is take few steps more than me. So the very human potential is distorted because people are in competition. Right now people believe that you will not propel yourself to your fullest if you are not in competition, which is a very false idea. Actually only when a human being is in a very extended periods of joyfulness, blissfulness, He will stretch himself to the limits and do what he could do to the fullest."
"Whole lot of people's ambition is to find a job to build their own house. Great achievements in life is this. If you want experience of life, build a house and see and conduct a wedding and see. These are the profound experiences of life. I think this is the dumbest way to approach life. This is what ambition means. You hold small things as too big, getting a job, earning a living, getting to a certain place of comfort, these are not great achievements in life. A human being is capable of something far, far bigger, okay? In finite, bigger than that. So please do not constrict yourself with simple ambitions, let there be a larger vision as to what you want to create, what is it that you want to create? As I said earlier, let me repeat this. The value of your life is only in these two things, profoundness of your experience, impactfulness of your activity. That's all that matters."
"Your life is not a tragedy because this happened that happened. Your life is a tragedy because everything is happening and you're missing it. Yes? This did not happen. That did not happen. That's not a tragedy. Sun came up in the morning but you cannot experience it. You're breathing. You cannot experience that. You're alive. You cannot experience that. You're alive. You cannot enjoy that. This is a tragedy, isn't it? Yes or no? What happened, what did not happen is not the point. The most significant aspect of your life is that you're alive right now. Is that so? Everything else is secondary and incidental. Is that so? Everything else is secondary and incidental. Is that so? Yes? But you are not aware of your aliveness, you are busy with your psychological nonsense."
"There's nothing to gain, nothing to lose in this life. You came with nothing. Whatever the hell is happening, you're on the Profits side. Isn't it so? Did you come with the investment? No. You come with nothing. So whatever the hell is happening, you're always on the Profit's side, isn't it? And anyway, they don't allow you to take a container in the end. So all you have is how profound intense and beautiful means your experience of life."
"What is the one thing that is essential to living a balanced life? Sense, organized religion, madness, marriage, cohabitation, competition, stupid, money, useful, best advice you have ever received. Nothing. If you had a day off with no commitments, no responsibilities, what would you spend the day doing? Generally if I have little time, all I do is play golf. What is one thing you'd like people to remember about you at the end of your life? They must live so wonderfully that they don't even remember me. What is the first thing you notice when you meet a person? Just everything. Pass, present and future. Is it more important to do what you love or love what you're doing? You will try to do what you love most. But if're doing? You will try to do what you love most. But if you're a genius, they will do just what is needed. If you could be invisible for a day, what would you do? You wouldn't know. One thing the world doesn't know about you. They don't know a thing about you."
"Idiots do things that they don't like to do suffer for their whole life because they think it's needed or they think it's their duty. Intelligent people do. What they love to do. They enjoy their life to some extent. But a genius learns to do what is needed joyfully. That's when your genius flowers. Because it's no more about you. Now, there's a limitless way of looking at life."
"It's apparent who does a very funny thing. You're trying to do something that nobody has ever known how to do it well. (Laughter) But you want to do your best. So what is the best thing you can do? First thing is to work upon yourself a little bit. Spend sufficient time with yourself. Look at yourself carefully. How you are, how you said, how you stand, how you speak, what you do, what you don't do. I think you must look at yourself very carefully because the children are picking up everything, rapidly and they'll exaggerate everything that you're doing. So one foremost thing is, at least make yourself in such a way that you would like to be. Somebody may not approve, it doesn't matter. At least you made yourself in such a way that you like the way you are. At least that much you must do. Maybe you cannot raise to somebody else's standards. We don't know what kind of standards this head for you. But at least you must become the way you like it the way you are."
"Well Mr. Bolt runs very fast, not because his tail is on fire, because his prepared his legs and lungs, because behind those legs and lungs there is a dedicated life, a life that is devoted to doing what they want to do. Mr. Bolt, people know him only like this. You not seen him training? Day in and day out they'll be training, they can't eat what they want, they are careful about everything. Every drop of what I eat drinks or what everything is measured and taken care of, but his glory is just nine seconds. Those nine seconds has years of preparation, whatever you want to do, whatever it is. Whether it is music, art, sport, business, spirituality, it doesn't matter what. Unless you're absolutely devoted to what you're doing, you will never do anything significant. You will do mediocre stuff, you will survive, make a living. But if you want to do something significant, you must be absolutely devoted to whatever you're doing."
"What can be the first thought when we feel like everything is going wrong? We need to understand this. We are born here with nothing and we'll die with nothing. In between whatever the hell is happening you are on the profit side. No matter what is happening you are still gaining, you can't lose. And anyway, life is not like your school or college, no matter which way you live. Everybody shall pass, so what's the problem"
"The only and only reason why you're unhappy is life is not happening the way you think it should happen. That's all it is. So if life is not happening the way you think it is, it should happen. You're unhappy. If life happens the way you think it should happen, you're happy. It's as simple as that. So if life has to happen the way you think it should happen. First of all, how you think with happen the way you think it should happen, first of all, how you think with how much focus you think, how much stability is there in your thought and how much reverberance is there in the thought process. Will determine whether your thought will become a reality or is it just an empty thought?"
"One basic ingredient of your life is time, and this is just going away. Already you are too hours closer to your grave since I came here. Yes or no? You are not immortal. It's just a limited amount of time."
"Wait, negative thoughts. Don't identify any thought as negative because it's just a thought. Who told you it's negative? It's just a thought. You're making it up, maybe you like it. What's the problem? If you understand this is just a thought, it has no power. If you think it's a reality, then it destroys you."
"Stress is not a consequence of your work. Stress is a consequence of your inability to manage your body, your thoughts, your emotions, your chemistry and your energy."
"In India, when you got married, they tied mangal sutram to you. mangal sutram means it's a sacred threat. It was supposed to be either raw, cotton thread, prepared in a certain way, or raw silt thread. Certain nadi, from your system is taken, and a certain nadi from your, the bit-road one is taken and the threat is prepared in a certain way and it's tied to you. Now the moment you have physical intimacy is not just the bodies that met two people's energies become like this. Now you can't break it. If you break it, you will have to severely damage both the people you have to tear them apart. This is how marriages were conducted."
"This is one thing that you can do if you have children. Vacation means don't take them to Mumbai, Bangalore, Dubai, some other place. Just take them, walk them in the jungle. Or take them on a small boat out there. Or whatever, some exposure to nature is needed. You will see how excited children will get and how involved they will become. You need to understand this, your physical, your physiological and psychological health. Can be very easily managed if you are in touch with the elements of nature, of water, soil, light and things like that. If the more exposed you are, the more balanced you are both physiologically and psychologically, which must happen to every human being."
"Whether it is alcohol or not, in life, why are we so apprehensive about being judged by others? And how can we not let this come on our way of being happy? Look at me. See, I'm always don't. Never touch this upstairs. But always don't. You can judge me whichever way you want. Because one thing is I am stunned in such a way that I have not lost my judgment at all. And at the same time, whichever way you judge me has absolutely no impact on me because I am completely stone. (Laughter) If you know how to manage this, you would be like me, always blissed out. Anybody can say, ""What they want? Anybody can do what they want?"" This is like this only because I have not given this privilege to anybody. That somebody can make me happy, somebody can make me unhappy, somebody can make me miserable. Right now you are a consequence of other people's opinions. Where do you plan to go like this? Anybody can ruin you. You went outside, somebody told you, ""Shriya, you are the most wonderful human being we have seen."" Then you were floating on that cloud. What number? What number? Nine. Oh, in South we do eleven., you were floating on cloud whatever number and you came home, people at home told you who you really are. And the cloud will crash. No, no. It's very important that neither this way or that way we listen to everybody because we could be doing something wrong. Hello? Any moment we could be doing something wrong. So we listen to everybody but what they say will not determine how I am, never, ever. This you must fix and you must tell your friend when she's not drunk. Otherwise, you won't understand."
"Respect is not something that you ever demand in your life. Please don't ever do such a vulgarity that you demand respect. You can only earn it. You cannot demand it. The moment you demand it, it becomes vulgar. This is no... So you stand one step higher than somebody and you demand respect. Or the only stupid thing that you did is you came here a few years earlier than someone else and you demand that I'm senior. So this is an unfortunate reality that's well established in the world that in the name of religion in the name of authority, in the name of parenthood, in many different ways. We have been trying to establish authority is the truth. Now, authority is not the truth. Truth is the only authority. Truth is the only authority. Nothing else is the authority."
"There are two kinds of people. Some people are interested in talking. Some people are interested in listening. You must decide which is wiser. Some people are interested in expression. Some people are interested in perception. It is perception which enhances your life. Not expression, analysis and psychiatry, went about saying, ""You must express otherwise you will go crazy."" You will express your madness. That's the biggest problem in the world. Everybody is busy expressing their madness in the world. Everybody is busy expressing their limitations in the world. Everybody is busy expressing their limitations in the world. Everybody is busy expressing their prejudices and opinions in the world. What is the use of this expression? Birds are tweeting. It's a little more pleasant than all these human beings tweeting. Expression is like an expanse of life, expanding it. Perception is enhancement of life. This life for you should be about enhancing it, not about expanding it."
"little over 200 years, or 6 million women were burned as witches in Europe alone. Because these are all women who had some capability. Once they have some capability, people will gather around them. Once people gather around somebody and find solutions, you cannot organize your project. They gave them the most horrible punishment of being burned alive so that this will go down. But still it lived for over 200 years, they had to kill a few million to put it down. So the feminine expressing anything, it's gone. Probably India and a few other Asian countries are the only countries where still feminine is under worship. Women are not some strange creatures. They are our mothers, wives, sisters, daughters. This is what they are. [Music]"
"You need to understand, trust does not mean. Somebody has to behave the way you expect them to behave. Trust means whatever they do, it's alright with you. If you come to such a state, otherwise don't do such a big word as trust. Trust means they must do what you expect them to do. This is a certain imprisonment you trust. Trust should empower people. Trust should not limit people, isn't it? The your idea of trust is to hold them in the way you want them to be. Trust, betrayal, this, that works. Don't get into all this nonsense. Just use your sense."
"If you're looking at other people who is wearing better clothes, who is driving better car, whose house is better than mine, if you look at this, your life is ruined. Because forever somebody will be wearing something better than you, somebody will be driving something better than you, somebody will be living in a better home than you. Yes or no? Forever you'll become enslaved to that nonsense. Don't ever start your life like that, all of you. You're being empowered through education. You must think in terms of what is it that I can create. What can I create in this life? Don't worry about how to earn a living with so much education and this many cerebral cells. You think earning can living is a problem and a Islam does it?"
"But Rama is also an insecure person, when Sita came back to him, Sita has to sit through a fire to prove that she is pure. For whom? So that other people will accept it. Now, let's come to this property. I'm asking, do you want a leader for this nation? Who puts the people of this nation above his own family and his personal love? Or do you want a the ritra? At any cost my son. You want a man who puts the citizens of this country above his family. This is not just another woman for him. He went and fought a battle for her, walked 3,000 kilometers. This is not just another woman. He is living for her, but still he sends her back to the jungle when she is pregnant. And he is putting the seeds, not just about Adobe. This is what you are mistaking. You are taking these things literally. When a dobi said, what it is being said is ordinary people are talking like this. Ordinary people have no trust in the king. That he is, she has just brought some woman from somewhere and she is made her our queen. Because queen is seen as a mother to the nation. We don't want such a woman as our mother, that's what they're saying. So if the king says, ""I don't care what you think, I love my wife and keep her."" That would be not a good king, not a good administrator. So he's putting his people about somebody that he loves very, very dearly. He's shooting in the cloud town. This is why we bow round to the man."
"Not everybody who keeps dung on you is your enemy. Not everybody who gets you out of shit is your friend. And above all, when you're in a heap of shit, keep your mouth shut. (Laughter) This is... This is... Now I'm saying this because... This is because we have created a world now, if I have trouble, I must talk to everybody in the world. They are all going to give thousands of solutions. No, when you feel you are in trouble, please just spend some time upon yourself. Invest some time and energy upon yourself because there is no trouble which troubles you except what you allow, isn't it? What is it? You must invest some time and energy upon yourself. This value of solitude is totally gone in the world in this generation. Please bring it back if you want to make yourself of some substance."
"If they are poor, they suffer their poverty. You make them rich, they suffer the taxes. If they are not educated, they suffer that. Put them to school, lot of suffering. Not married, they suffer that. Get them married. I didn't say anything. I didn't say a thing, okay? No children, some people suffer that. Children, daily suffering. So you seem to be suffering every aspect of life. So if you offer death, will you go joyfully? No, you will suffer that. So tell me one thing that we are not suffering. Now people, we will also feast life is suffering. No, no, life is not suffering. Not is it a joy? It's simply there, it's a phenomena. If you ride it, it feels fantastic. If you're crushed by it, it feels terrible."
"Love is not a relationship. A relationship is a different thing. Love is a certain sweetness of your emotion. Whether you look at a tree, a dog or a man or a woman or a child or just a disguise, why can't you look at it loving you? Because it's not about loving the sky. It's about the sweetness of your emotion, if your emotions are sweet, whatever you look at. You'll look at it in a certain way. So you have always associated love with somebody. No, no, no. This is not about somebody. Love is not something that you do. It is something that you can become. If you just make your emotions sweet, your emotions are sweet and it's beautiful. We'll be like this. It's not about anybody. If somebody comes we can share it. If nobody comes you can sit here with the ice clothes and still be loving what's the problem. It is not about somebody. It's not an action. It is not something that you do. It is something that you can become."
"If you like somebody, you will exaggerate them in your mind. If you dislike somebody, for sure you will exaggerate them in your mind. Exaggeration means you are unable to see things as they are. If you are unable to see things as they are, you can never handle life the way it should be."
"You do whatever the hell you want. Just do it well. It's important. And don't do any damn thing that you will be ashamed of doing tomorrow. Isn't it? What other people say it doesn't matter. But you should not be ashamed of what you have done. Isn't it so? This much pride and freedom you must keep in your life. It doesn't matter the whole world says you're wrong. But you are not ashamed of what you have done. That much you must always keep in your life. If that one thing, if you give up, I'm telling you, you live a very poor life. You may have everything, but you will have done. That much you must always keep in your life. If that one thing if you give up, I'm telling you you live a very poor life. You may have everything, but you'll have nothing."
"In your life, if you do not do what you cannot do, no problem. But if you do not do what you can do, you're a disaster. I am not a disaster."
Idiots do things that they don't like to do suffer for their whole life because they think it's needed or they think it's their duty. Intelligent people do. What they love to do. They enjoy their life to some extent. But a genius learns to do what is needed joyfully. That's when your genius flowers. Because it's no more about you.
"People think there is something called as negative thought and positive thought. They want to remove the negative thoughts and have only positive thought. For such people, I would ask them to just experiment for 10, 15 seconds. For example, next 10 seconds, just don't think of a monkey. You will see, you will be full of monkeys. So what I am saying is, this is the nature of your mind, is what you want to remove will become your quality, always you will be on it."
"The moment you are educated, you start thinking logically about every aspect of your life. You try to logically add up your life and it doesn't add up on your stress flow. Simply for nothing, nothing has gone wrong, sun came up, there is oxygen in the air and you've eaten your breakfast and you're stressed. For what? Because you stupid logic you're trying to add up what is today and it is not adding up and you are miserable."
"2:49
You know, in the Western societies they talk about midlife crisis
2:54
it usually starts around thirty-three, thirty-four years of age.
2:58
Suddenly people don't know what to do with themselves; life getting meaningless, or
3:04
those who are successful, they find traction
3:08
and suddenly they explode into different levels of success or well-being.
3:14
All this can happen, because within the system
3:19
it has completed a certain cycle; either it can take off or it can crash.
3:29
So, sadhana for before thirty-three years of age is one kind
3:34
that is more preparatory in nature, so that when that moment comes,
3:39
they will be able to make it into a positive time in their life.
3:45
Because how positive it becomes at the age of thirty-two to thirty-three years of age,
3:50
this will largely determine the trajectory of one's life and impact in the entire life.
3:57
Your entire life will be largely the trajectory of that will be decided at that.
4:03
If life doesn't really take off at that level, then you may do well but,
4:09
you will never fly, you will… you know, uphill task.
4:16
Not that you can never fly, that's a wrong thing to say, but difficult; you need more fuel to fly
4:23 
you will need lot more fuel to fly. But if you’ve brought your life 
4:29 
your physiological structures, your energy structures, your internal geometry, 
4:34 
if you’ve brought it to a certain level of maturity by the time you're thirty-three, 
4:39 
then life takes off much more effortlessly; otherwise, it will need much more effort."
"add question at beginning :

control excitement
0:30
Why do you want to control excitement?
0:34
I want you to be in a state of excitement all the time.
0:40
because, see... people have been telling you this,
0:43
'if you're too happy, sadness will follow.' Hmm?
0:48
Do you understand? They have been saying this, traditionally?
0:51
So, you're laughing too much, so tomorrow you will cry. (Laughter)
0:56 
This observation has come because 
1:00 
you are not functioning from your awareness, you're cyclical in your nature.
3:29
The idea that we're existing here is to experience life
3:32
as intensely and as deeply as it’s possible.
3:35
Everything that you're doing is only for that.
3:38
But, because of your fear of disaster,
3:41
you're killing yourself, and keeping yourself half alive.
3:45
That’s not the answer, that’s not a solution at all.
3:49
So, how not to be excited is not the question.
3:53
How not to make excitement into a disaster:
3:56
you must earn the necessary balance within you.
3:59
Everything that we're doing is only in that direction."
"5:16 to 6:21 (or 6:27 for more complete closing)
5:16
Right from my childhood, I have been noticing this
5:20
that most adults want to teach something when they see children
5:27
all those damn things which have not worked in their life.
5:33
This is one vow you have to take with me, that is,
5:37
from this moment onwards in your life,
5:39
you will not pass on anything
5:42
that has not worked for you to anybody else.
5:46
Allô ?
5:49
Even if you cannot pass on the best things to other people,
5:52
at least what has not worked for you, you don't give it to anybody.
5:55
Will you do this?
5:59
Does anger work for you ?
6:01
So don't give it to anybody.
6:04
Does misery work for you?
6:06
Does depression work for you?
6:10
So if you are angry, if you're depressed, you're miserable,
6:14
just shut up.
6:16
Okay?
6:18
And sit in one place and handle it."
"0.35 - 1:35

0:33
If you invest your life to create something
0:36
which has got nothing to do with you and something to do with everything,
0:41
then slowly it will seep into you, into every cell in your body that everything is actually a part of you.
0:52
To simply sit here and get it, we don’t know you may take many lifetimes.
0:59
Most people won’t get it, they may get one thought and tomorrow morning, it’ll be.. out.
1:08
But, if you invest your time, energy and life into creating something which is not about you at all,
1:16
then slowly it sinks into you,
1:20
every cell, every atom in the body will soak it up and make you understand that your life,
1:27
the way you are is actually all inclusive.
1:32
Otherwise, it’s just a talk."
"1.04-2.04
1:03
You can only wait upon somebody or something when you do not think much of yourself.
1:12
If you’re absolute nothing, you can wait on anything.
1:16
If you think too much of yourself, you cannot wait upon anything or anybody.
1:24
You will see, the more educated people become, the more affluent people become,
1:32
they cannot wait.
1:37
Have you seen this?
1:40
People who don’t think much of themselves, you ask a villager comes here, you tell him,
1:45
‘Just wait,’ he’ll simply sit there whole day,
1:49
but you ask an educated man to wait,
1:52
(Gestures - hastily looks at his watch and looks up) (Laughter).
1:57
In a minute he will look at his watch five times because he cannot wait,
2:02
because he thinks too much of himself.
2:05
One who does not think much of himself can simply wait."
"1.12-2.05
1:11
I remember twenty-five years ago or thirty years ago, when I was building the foundation you know,
1:18
I had to go into those booth with a black phone and make hundred, two-hundred calls at a time.
1:24
Today if I just think about it my phone calls, all right?
1:28
If I say a word, it will call who I want and it’s done.
1:32
So life has become so much better because of a phone.
1:35
But now people are in a state of compulsiveness,
1:38
anything you give they’re so compulsive, they make it into suffering.
1:43
Compulsive eating, compulsive drinking, compulsive everything.
1:48
So the problem is not phone, problem is not something else; compulsiveness is the problem.
1:53
The solution is only consciousness, there is no other way (Laughs).
1:56
Speaker: And controlling our self.
1:58
Sadhguru: No, not controlling, becoming conscious.
2:02
If you become conscious, you are liberated, not controlled."
"2.00-3.15
2:00
“Once you sit with me even for a moment,
2:06
then there is no such thing as privacy in your life.”
2:11
So the moment you sat with me,
2:13
particularly initiated by me,
2:15
after that there is no such thing as whether it is on or not –
2:18
it is on all the time.
2:20
It is just that you are expecting grace just to fulfill your plans.
2:27
Most people are only expecting grace to fulfill their plans,
2:31
because this is the old habit of going to the temple, church or mosque
2:35
and telling God what he must do. (Laughs)
2:40
If he does not do, you will change your God.
2:44
So this is the old habit.
2:46
So, grace is not about fulfilling your plan.
2:49
Grace is about fulfilling life's plan for you.
2:54
This is not about fulfilling your petty plan,
2:57
because every day your plans keep changing.
2:59
At different stages in your life,
3:01
many, many times you thought “this is it”
3:03
and next moment you changed your decision.
3:06
So grace, a Guru's grace is not designed to fulfill your plans.
3:12
Guru's grace is designed to fulfill the life's plan."
"2.30- 3.22
2:30
If by the day if you are becoming a more joyful human being -
2:36
you just keep accounts of this on a daily basis,
2:39
‘From yesterday to today, am I little more joyful?’
2:43
If you’re keeping accounts and if you are becoming more and more joyful
2:47
by the day and your face, instead of becoming like this, is… slowly is
2:51
becoming like this, that means you’re progressing.
2:57
Yes, you are definitely progressing; because spirituality is not some nonsense up there,
3:06
it is about becoming available to life process in its fullest possibility,
3:12
not just to the physicality, not just to the mentality,
3:15
to becoming available to life process in its fullest scope – this is spirituality."
"2.58-4.02
2:58
prayer is not just vocal.
3:01
Prayer is a way of involving your whole body,
3:05
and getting it into a certain attitude of receptivity, of seeing.
3:12
Prayer is essentially seeing that your presence here is so miniscule, actually.
3:18
Hmm? You are just a speck of dust in this existence.
3:22
tomorrow morning ‘woof!’ if you disappear, nobody is going to miss you.
3:27
A few people around you will cry for 3 days, and then they will forget about you.
3:31
Rest of the existence will just go on fine without you, isn’t it?
3:36
All of this disappear,
3:38
still this world will go on wonderfully well, maybe better. [Laughter]
3:44
Yes, or no?
3:46
This self-assumed importance that man has created within himself,
3:50
when you keep it aside, you are in prayer."
"10:45 - 11:41
10:46
external arrangements is not going to fix this life.
10:49
It's very, very important
10:50
that you make inner arrangements
10:53
that even if they send you to hell, you will go joyfully.
10:58
You’ve heard of Gautama the Buddha?
11:01
Heard of Buddha?
11:04
When everybody was talking about going to heaven,
11:06
Gautama said, “What will I go and do in heaven
11:10
because you say everything is wonderful there?
11:12
What will I do there?
11:14
Let me go to hell.
11:17
Because you say everybody is suffering there,
11:19
let me go and do something because anyway I cannot suffer.
11:22
I made myself like this I cannot suffer,
11:25
so let me go to hell.”
11:26
Even now the Buddhist texts talk about
11:29
Buddha being in the lower world.
11:31
Well, you should have this kind of freedom,
11:34
isn’t it so?
11:36
“Even if I go to hell, I will live well.
11:40
Nobody has to send me to heaven”"
"5:32 - 6:30
5:31
When you were eighteen, twenty, you fell in love with somebody,
5:36
you couldn’t wipe their image off your mind, isn’t it?
5:40
Simply there, all the time!
5:43
Because when your emotion gets attached to something, your mind just stays there.
5:48
Everything that you think, everything that you do, your very energies get oriented in that direction
5:53
because your emotions are attached to something.
5:56
So, this is what Parvati did,
5:58
that she attached her emotions to Adiyogi in such a way that emotion which starts as love became devotion.
6:12
Devotion means it is a solution which slowly dissolves you, makes you less and less of yourself.
6:22
So, she came to her enlightenment that way.
6:26
She came to know the beyond in that sense."

If you treat them as your property

if you treat them as such,

you are committing a certain sacrilege against Creation and the Creator
1:35

Sadhguru: Only problem is you have lost the ability to enjoy the suspense.

You are a fixed match.

So you go to your astrologer, you write a ‘horror scope’ and everything and say,

“What will happen? What will happen?”

No, you should not know what will happen.

Hello? Participants: Yes.

Sadhguru: If you are (Laughs) a joyful state, more unpredictability, more fun, isn't it so?
5:08
If you are miserable, even smallest suspense will freak the hell out of us.
5:14
Yes or no? Participants: Yes.

Sadhguru: The problem is just this, you lost your ability to enjoy the suspense.

Nothing wrong with life."
"2:45-3:38 + 4:04-4:08
2:40
– but always a bath means the first pail of water is on your head, always.
2:46
Putting cold water on your body will shift the heat into your brain, very rapidly, it should not happen.
2:54
So this is why those who don't want to wet their hair,
2:59
at least should take a little bit of cold water and put it... you know there's a point here…
3:05
in line with your ears here, at that point you put little cold water,
3:10
immediately you will see a certain cooling happens in the head region;
3:14
after that you can have bath with just the body.
3:18
But otherwise, you always... the first pail of water is over your head, not on your body.
3:24
So what you do is, you fill the bucket and… (Gesture)
3:29
That's the best way to do it in the morning.
3:31
The body should be immersed in water, that you're trying to create a simulated dip in the river, ok?

3:43
at least the skin should be covered in water at the same time.
3:47
Not like this, this, this, like this, this, this, you know.
3:52
If you pour water, the whole body… the body should think you're taking it for a dip.
4:00
So if you pour like this,
4:04
there is a certain coolness in the system and muscles become very flexible.
4:08
Shower can do it to you. If the shower is forceful enough
4:13
or at least if the volume of water is good enough, shower can easily do that."
"9:03-10:05
9:03
Any kind of physical contact happens with somebody,
9:06
a period of more than let's say six minutes, if you're even holding somebody's hand,
9:13
before you do yoga it's best that you have a shower.
9:18
This is not a cleansing thing.
9:20
We are not trying to clean the body, that's not the point.
9:23
It's not because somebody is impure – you're trying to clean your body.
9:27
Yoga is a way of organizing your energies into an individual.
9:33
So if any kind of transaction happen too much
9:37
– if I come and sit in a program, I'm not even physically touching anybody
9:42
– if I sit in a program for two-three hours,
9:46
first thing is shower because just the interaction creates a certain amount of…
9:57
the integrity of your energy becomes little loose.
10:01
So at any time, first thing when you go home, shower.

Shower need not mean soap, shampoo, this, that, a bucket full of water ""bubum,"""

You are a bundle of thoughts, emotions, ideas, opinions and prejudices.

That is more dominant than the life in you, isn't it?
11:07
Yes or no?
11:08
Your thought and emotion is occupying more space
11:12
than the aliveness that you are.
11:15
So you are not experiencing yourself as a piece of life.
11:17
You are experiencing yourself
11:19
as a bundle of thought and emotion and whatever else.
11:23
This is a wrong perception.
11:25
Because you are alive, you may think.
11:29
Do you understand?
11:31
Not because you think that you exist.
11:33
Because you are alive you may think if you wish,
11:36
but right now the thought process has become so compulsive
11:40
that people think that is more dominant
11:43
or is predominant to life.
11:46
It is not so.
11:47
It does not

Your thought does not exist before life.

We were the only real economy, everybody wanted to come to India.

Not because they were in love with you, because this was the richest land, that is why everybody
3:20
wanted to come here. One Vasco Da Gama reached here, many drowned in the ocean,
3:25
but still they wanted to come because this was the richest land on the planet.
3:30
Like right now, everybody wants to go to America because it’s the richest nation on the planet.
3:36
So, with… without a sense of conquest, we became a very vibrant economy.
3:45
This is a very unique achievement, which we need to bring back to this world, because
3:51

You believed in God and destroyed so much of this world. Now you believe in yourself, what will you do?
4:24
(Laughter/Applause)
4:30
All this trash is coming from the West. You don't have to be motivated.
4:35
You just have to see how this (Referring to oneself) is alive to its fullest possible level right now.
4:41
If it's fully alive, it will do everything that it can do, isn't it?

What it cannot do, anyway it will not do."
"4'47"" - 6'11""
4:47
So, corruption is not in one place, it is across the nation.
4:53
Let me tell you this.
4:54
A few years ago – almost twenty-five years ago – I was in Trichy talking in a high
4:58
school – two fourteen-year-old boys.
5:02
I was just asking them, “Okay, what would you like to do after this education?”
5:06
One guy said, “I want to be RTO” (Laughter).
5:13
Fourteen-year-old boy!
5:14
Then I say, “Why?
5:15
Are you interested in the road traffic system, you want to do something, what is your interest?”
5:20
He says, “I’ll get lot of bribe” (Laughter).
5:27
I thought this is the tragedy of the nation.
5:29
A fourteen-year-old boy – still a child in some ways.
5:36
Only thing he is thinking of is…he is thinking how he can get maximum bribe – fourteen
5:42
years of age.
5:45
So don’t think just one point is corruption; corruption is all across.
5:50
We have made this our culture.
5:53
Young people must change this.
5:55
It is very important you make this nation a law-abiding nation more than anything else,
6:03
that you follow the law; convenient or inconvenient, you follow the law.
6:07
This is important.
6:09
You must set this culture."
"21'05 - 22'00
21:08
If you think this child belongs to you, when he is just becoming… coming into teens,
21:15
he is telling you, “Goddammit I don’t belong to you” (Laughter).
21:19
That’s all he is trying to tell you which you are not able to digest.
21:23
Another life does not belong to you.
21:26
If another life has chosen to be with you, please cherish that, it’s a tremendous thing
21:32
(Applause).
21:36
Whether it’s your husband or your wife or your children - they don’t belong to you.
21:41
You don’t own them in any sense.
21:44
If you don’t get it, you will understand when you die or they die.
21:48
They don’t belong to you."
"1:13:50 to 1:14:37

the parent and child relationship is that of love you must increase the love

volume and do what you want to do now
1:14:06
the problem is when you when they say no you will get angry and say nasty things
1:14:11
no you should not react like that you must respond by increasing the love
1:14:16

"2:07 - 3:55
2:04 
Now... as a yogi, 
2:11 
I, as far as possible, 
2:16 
I will never consume anything which is cooked, which is more than an hour-and-a-half old. 
2:24 
While we are serving the food, the way we're serving in the ashram, 
2:30 
is hoping that all of you will graduate 
2:35 
from being yoga practioners, to yogis. 
2:41 
Not just bending and twisting, 
2:46 
you are beginning to feel the union in the existence. 
2:52 
If this has to happen, body has to be sensitive, 
2:57 
and it has to have a minimum level of inertia. 
3:03 
Now... if you eat food 
3:07 
which in some way has deteriorated; it may not be rotten, 

3:19 
It is just that, it will lower your perception. 
3:24 
In my experience of life, for me, 
3:29 
lower perception is death - at least death of the yogi. (laughs) 
3:35 
The man may live, the yogi's dead, because he's lost his perception, 
3:42 
he's lost his sensitivity. 
3:44 
So... the death of sensitivity, if it doesn’t matter to you, 
3:50 
there's really no problem, you can eat what you want. You can eat garbage, and still survive. 
3:56 
Well, people are eating food that was cooked a week ago, ten days ago, 
4:02 
three months ago, they’re keeping it in their refrigerators and eating.

there's a price to it. Only maximum till they are two-and-a-half to three years of age,
4:18
you can give them milk. After that, they don't need cow's milk at all.
4:23
And you're not even drinking cow's milk, you don't know what kind of milk you're drinking,
4:28
because it's ten million animals' milk, all mixed up and you're drinking. It's just insane -
4:36
it's the most insane way to consume. It's supposed to be modern and scientific,
4:40
I don't know what's scientific about it. You drink a million cows' milk mixed up, buffalo mil...
4:47
cow, every damn thing and you drink it, have you got any sense in your head, I'm asking?

23:08
little distance isn't it once there is a little distance there is simply no problem about anything
23:15
once there is a distance between you and your body between you and your mind that is the end of suffering so how do we get
23:22
there there are many ways to approach this one simple way in a brief
23:28
conversation like this is uh
23:35
you know like we've offered this to millions of people across the world it's called isha kriya it's a simple way
23:40
of using your breath and thought to remind yourself initially intellectually
23:46
but if you stay with the breath why the breath is see you're inhaling and exhaling inhalation
23:54
exhalation inhalation exhalation is happening all the time
24:01
exhalation next inhalation did not happen well you and your body fall apart

24:40
consciously always you will hold a distance"
